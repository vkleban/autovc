# AutoVC is your personal due-dilligence consultant


    🤥 Don't trust everything model says

    😒 Do not take it too seriously

    🤬 Model may mistakenly be offensive


## Vision

My name is **Vitaly Kleban** (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkleban/) and I run large-scale nation-wide networks in 6 countries around the world. 


I'm interested in the VC business in general and in the AI applications for this asset class in particular. For several years I do technical due diligence for the venture funds as a hobby 🔍. Means I don't charge for it 🧑‍💻.

I’m convinced that the venture capital industry is now at an inflection point, just like the hedge fund industry was in the 1980s 📈🕰️, and I am willing to jump onboard and use my skills to move it forward 🚀💡.


## Motivation

Early-stage discussions between startups and VCs can indeed be repetitive and time-consuming, often leading to unproductive outcomes. Startups may find themselves investing valuable time talking to VCs who won't ultimately invest, while VCs might not be efficiently focusing on the most promising targets. ⏳

Innovative solutions are needed to streamline this process and make it more efficient, benefiting both parties. Finding a way to sidestep unproductive early conversations can help narrow down the top of the deal-flow funnel for funds and provide startups with more meaningful opportunities. This would be a win-win for the venture capital ecosystem! 🚀🌟🎯


## How to use the prompt

0. Prepare a **text-only elevator pitch** of the startup (or take one from example).
1. Start a new chat with **GPT-4**. It won't work on GPT-3.5.
2. Copy the text from the [VC-prompt.txt] (VC-prompt.txt) to the chat.
3. Investor will ask you questions. Answer the questions as long as you can.
4. Use **/score** command to see your score and investment desicion.
5. Use **/meeting** command to start one more meeting with the investor.

There are some limitations in place: unfortunately the size of the GPT-4 context is very limited and after a long conversation our VC investor get tired and stop asking good questions 😴.


## Example of conversation

> **Startup:**  Here is a pitch. At ClosedAI, we are pioneering the future of artificial intelligence to benefit all of humanity. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits everyone and doesn't harm humanity or concentrate power in the wrong hands. We're at the forefront of cutting-edge research in AI, and our team of world-class researchers and engineers is committed to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. We've developed some of the most advanced language models like LGPT+4, which can understand and generate human-like text. These models have applications across a wide range of industries, from natural language processing and content generation to virtual assistants and more. But our vision goes beyond just language models. We're working on creating safe and beneficial AGI, and we're actively researching ways to make AGI safe and ensuring its deployment is used for the betterment of society. We're open to collaboration and partnerships with organizations that share our values and commitment to ethical AI development. In a world where AI is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, ClosedAI is your trusted partner in shaping the future of AI, making it accessible, safe, and beneficial for everyone.

> **Investor**: Your mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits everyone. Can you elaborate on the specific problem you're addressing in the current AI landscape? How is it affecting potential customers?

> **Startup**: We try to build an AGI that is safe and aligned with basic human rights and values.

> **Investor**: 
**Observation:** It seems like your focus is on creating an AGI that is safe and respects human rights and values. This is a crucial aspect, especially considering the potential risks associated with AGI.
**Question:** Can you share more about how you're ensuring the safety and alignment of your AGI with human values? What measures or technologies are you implementing to achieve this? 🦀
